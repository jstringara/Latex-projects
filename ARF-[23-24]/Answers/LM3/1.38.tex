\question

What is $\Leb^\infty$? Which is the relation between functions finite a.e. and essentially bounded functions? Justify the answer.

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsection{Definition of \texorpdfstring{$\Leb^\infty$}{the set of essentially bounded functions}}
Let $(X, \A, \mu)$ be a measure space. A function $f\in\Mes(X,\A)$ is said to be essentially bounded if:
\[
    \esssup_X f < +\infty
\]
and we define the set of essentially bounded functions as:
\[
    \Leb^\infty (X,\A,\mu) \coloneqq \{ f:X\to\Rcomp : \; \text{ f is essentially bounded }\}
\]

\subsection{Relation between functions finite a.e. and essentially bounded functions}
We have that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f\in\Leb^\infty \implies f$ is finite a.e. in $X$;
    \item in general if $f$ is finite a.e. in $X$ $\centernot\implies f\in\Leb^\infty$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We can easily see that:
              \[
                  |f| \leq \esssup |f| < + \infty \text{ almost everywhere in } X
              \]
              thus $f$ is finite almost everywhere in $X$;
        \item Let us assume that:
              \[
                  f \text{ is finite a.e. in }  X \implies f\in\Leb^\infty
              \]
              and let us see a clear counterexample of this, take:
              \[
                  f(x): \R \to \Rcomp \coloneqq \begin{cases}
                      \frac{1}{|x|} & x \neq 0 \\
                      + \infty      & x = 0
                  \end{cases}
              \]
              Clearly $f$ is finite in $E=\R\setminus\{0\}$, i.e. $f$ is finite a.e. in $\R$. Let us note that $\lambda(\{0\}) = 0 $. Thus:
              \[
                  \esssup_X |f| = +\infty \implies f \notin \Leb^\infty
              \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
