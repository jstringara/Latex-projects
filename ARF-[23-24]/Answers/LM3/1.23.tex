\question
Is it true that any subset $E\subseteq\R$ is $\Leb$-measurable? Is it possibile to find two disjoint sets
$A,B\subset\R$ for which $\lambda^*(A \cup B) < \lambda^*(A) + \lambda^*(B)$? Why?

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsection{Vitali's non-measurable sets}
Any measurable set $E\subseteq \R$ with $\lambda(E)>0$ contains a subset that fails to be measurable. \\
Therefore there exist subsets of $\R$ that are not $\Leb$-measurable.

\subsection{Disjoints sets for which \texorpdfstring{$\lambda^*(A\cup B) < \lambda^*(A)+\lambda^*(B)$}{the measure of the union is less than the sum of the measure}}
There are disjoint sets $A,B\subseteq\R$ for which:
\[
    \lambda^*(A\cup B) < \lambda^*(A)+\lambda^*(B)
\]

\begin{proof}
    Assume by contradiction that:
    \[
        \lambda^*(A\cup B) = \lambda^*(A)+\lambda^*(B) \quad \forall A,B \subseteq\R, \; A\cap B = \emptyset
    \]
    Now $\forall E,Z \subseteq \R$ we write:
    \[
        \lambda^*(\underbrace{Z\cap E}_{=A}) + \lambda^*(\underbrace{Z\cap E^{\complement}}_{=B}) = \lambda^*(\underbrace{Z}_{=A\cup B})
    \]
    thus any set $E$ would satisfy the Caratheodory condition (\ref{CarEq}) and be $\Leb$-measurable which is absurd since we know that Vitali's sets exist.
\end{proof}
