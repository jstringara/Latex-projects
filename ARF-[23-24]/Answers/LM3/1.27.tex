Prove that continuous functions are both Borel and Lebesgue measurable.

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsection{Continuous functions are \texorpdfstring{$\B$}{Borel}-measurable}
A continuous function $f:X\to X'$ is $\B$-measurable.

\begin{proof}
    Let $\mathcal{C}'$ be the class of open sets of $X'$ and $\mathcal{C}$ the class of open sets of $X$. We have:
    \[
        \forall E \in \mathcal{C}' \quad f^{-1}(E)\in\mathcal{C} \subseteq \B \; (\text{ by definition of continuity })
    \]
    and $\B'=\sigma_0(\mathcal{C}')$ so we get the thesis.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Continuous functions are \texorpdfstring{$\Leb$}{Lebesgue}-measurable}
A continuous function $f:X\to X'$ is $\Leb$-measurable.

\begin{proof}
    Since $\B \subset \Leb$ and the previous statement has been proven true, the thesis follows trivially.
\end{proof}
