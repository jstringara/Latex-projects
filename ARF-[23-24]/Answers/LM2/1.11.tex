Write the definition of complete measure space. Exhibit an example of a measure space which is not complete.

\subsection*{Solution}
\subsection{Complete measure space}
A measure space $(X,\A,\mu)$ is said to be complete if $\tau_{\mu}\subseteq\A$
\subsubsection{Counterexample}
Let $X=\{a,b,c\}$, $\A = \sigma (\{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b,c\}, X \})$ and $\mu\equiv 0$, clearly here we have:
\[
    \tau_{\mu} \setminus \mathcal{N}_{\mu}= \{ \{b\}, \{c\} \}    
\]
and clearly $\{b\}, \{c\} \notin \A$. So this measure space is not complete.
