What is the Caratheodory condition? How can it be stated in an equivalent way? Prove it.

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsection{Caratheodory condition} \label{CarEq}
Let $\mu^*$ be an outer measure on a set $X$, then we say that $E\subset X$ is $\mu^*$-measurable if:
\[
    \mu^*(Z) = \mu^*(Z\cap E) + \mu^*(Z\setminus E) \quad \forall Z\subset X
\]

\subsection{Equivalent statement}\label{CarIneq}
Let $\mu^*$ be an outer measure on a set $X$, then we say that $E\subset X$ is $\mu^*$-measurable if and only if:
\[
    \mu^*(Z) \geq \mu^*(Z\cap E) + \mu^*(Z\setminus E) \quad \forall Z\subset X
\]
\begin{proof}
    It is enough to note that $\forall E\subseteq X$ we have:
    \[
        Z = (Z\cap E) \cup (Z \cap E^\complement) \quad \forall Z\subset X
    \]
    and thus by the subadditivity of $\mu^*$ (\ref{outer:sub}) we get:
        \[
        \mu^*(Z) \leq \mu^*(Z\cap E) + \mu^*(Z\setminus E) \quad \forall Z\subset X
    \]
    and we may combine this inequality with the other to yield an equality.
\end{proof}
