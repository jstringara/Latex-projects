\question
State the theorem concerning generation of a measure as a restriction of an outer measure.

\subsection*{Solution}
\subsection{Generation of a measure from an outer measure}\label{meas:gen}
\provdef[$\mathcal{L}$]
\[
    \mathcal{L} \coloneqq \{ E\subseteq X : \; E \text{ is } \mu^*-\text{measurable } \}
\]
where $\mu^*$ is an outer measure on $X$, then:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item the collection $\Leb$ is a $\salg$
    \item $\mu^* |_{\Leb}$ is a complete measure on $\Leb$
\end{enumerate}
