\question
Is the translate of a measurable set measurable?

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsection{The translate of a measurable set is measurable}
The translate of a measurable set is also measurable. \\
Let us see a simple example: let $(a,b)$ be an interval and $(a+h,b+h)$ its translate.
\begin{align*}
     & \lambda((a,b)) = b-a                   \\
     & \lambda((a+h,b+h)) = (b+h)-(a+h) = b-a
\end{align*}
