\section{Introduction}
We will study LÃ©vy processes and extend the Black and Scholes theory.
We will depart from analytical formulas and use MonteCarlo techniques, partial
differential equations, partial differential integral equations and Fast-Fourier
transforms.

\section{Black and Scholes}
The Black and Scholes model is defined by the following stochastic differential
equation:
\[
    \left \{
        \begin{array}{l}
            dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t \\
            S_0 = s 
        \end{array}
    \right .
\]
